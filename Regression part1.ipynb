    "1.Simple Linear regression:\n",
    "  Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a single independent variable (predictor) and a dependent variable (response). \n",
    "  The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes the relationship between the variables. \n",

    "  In this case, b(o) is the intercept, b(1) is the slope, and ε accounts for any unexplained variability in the scores.\n",
    "2.Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "    Multiple linear regression extends the concept of simple linear regression to multiple independent variables. \n",
    "    Instead of predicting the dependent variable based on just one predictor, multiple linear regression involves multiple predictors. \n",
    "    The equation for multiple linear regression is given by:\n",

    "Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you check whether these assumptions hold in\n",
    "a given dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumptions of linear regression are:\n",
    "1.Linearity:\n",
    "   Assumption: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear. This means that changes in the independent variable are associated with constant and proportional changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    "   Checking: Scatter plots of the variables can help visualize their relationships. If the scatter plot exhibits a roughly straight line pattern, the linearity assumption may hold.\n",
    "2.Independence of Errors:\n",
    "   Assumption: The errors (residuals) should be independent. This means that the error term for one observation should not predict the error term for another observation.\n",
    "   Checking: Plotting residuals against the predicted values or time (for time series data) can help identify patterns or dependencies in the errors.\n",
    "3.Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors):\n",
    "   Assumption: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). In other words, the spread of residuals should be roughly the same for all values of the predictors.\n",
    "   Checking: Plotting residuals against predicted values and checking for a consistent spread can help identify heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "4.Normality of Errors:\n",
    "   Assumption: The errors should be normally distributed. This assumption is necessary for valid hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "   Checking: A histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals can be used to assess normality. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test can also be applied.\n",
    "5.No Perfect Multicollinearity:\n",
    "   Assumption (for multiple linear regression): There should be no perfect linear relationship between the independent variables. Multicollinearity can lead to instability in coefficient estimates.\n",
    "   Checking: Calculate the variance inflation factor (VIF) for each independent variable. High VIF values may indicate multicollinearity.\n",
    "6.No Autocorrelation (for Time Series Data):\n",
    "   Assumption (for time series data): If your data is time-dependent, the residuals should not be correlated with each other.\n",
    "   Checking: Plotting residuals against time can help identify patterns. Autocorrelation functions (ACF) or the Durbin-Watson statistic can be used for more formal testing.\n",
    "Methods for Checking Assumptions:\n",
    "1.Residual Analysis:\n",
    "   Examine residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) for patterns. Plotting residuals against predicted values or independent variables can help identify issues.\n",
    "2.Normality Tests:\n",
    "   Use statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or visual inspection of histograms and Q-Q plots to assess the normality of residuals.\n",
    "3.Scatter Plots:\n",
    "   Examine scatter plots of the independent variables against the dependent variable to assess linearity.\n",

    "Interpretation:\n",
    "  Intercept (b(o)):\n",
    "     The intercept of $50,000 represents the estimated house price when the size of the house (X) is zero. However, in the context of house prices, it might not make sense for a house to have zero square feet, so the intercept might not have a meaningful interpretation in this scenario.\n",
    "  Slope (b(1)):\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of $200 means that, on average, for every additional square foot in the size of the house, the predicted house price increases by $200.\n",
    "If a house is 1000 square feet larger than another, you would expect the predicted price to be $200,000 higher (1000 square feet * $200).\n",
    "So, in this example, the slope and intercept provide insights into how the size of the house influences its predicted price.\n",

    "regression? In what situations would you prefer to use polynomial regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "1.Captures Non-linear Relationships:\n",
    "  Polynomial regression can model non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables, providing a more flexible representation of the underlying data patterns.\n",
    "2.Versatility:\n",
    "  It can handle a wide range of data patterns, from simple linear relationships to more complex curves.\n",
    "3.Higher Order Approximation:\n",
    "  By introducing higher-degree terms (quadratic, cubic, etc.), polynomial regression can approximate more intricate shapes in the data.\n",
    "Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "1.Overfitting:\n",
    "  Polynomial regression models with high degrees can become overly complex and fit the training data too closely, leading to overfitting. This may result in poor generalization to new, unseen data.\n",
    "2.Interpretability:\n",
    "  As the degree of the polynomial increases, the interpretability of the model diminishes. It becomes challenging to provide a clear interpretation of the individual coefficients.\n",
    "3.Sensitivity to Outliers:\n",
    "  Polynomial regression can be sensitive to outliers, particularly when fitting higher-degree polynomials. Outliers can disproportionately influence the shape of the curve.\n",
    "4.Computational Complexity:\n",
    " Fitting higher-degree polynomials requires more computational resources, making it computationally more intensive compared to linear regression.\n",
    "When to Use Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "1.Non-linear Patterns:\n",
    "  When the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is clearly non-linear, polynomial regression can better capture these patterns.\n",
    "2.Curved Relationships:\n",
    "  In situations where the data exhibits a curve or curvature, polynomial regression can provide a better fit than linear regression.\n",
    "3.Exploratory Data Analysis:\n",
    "  Polynomial regression can be useful in the exploratory data analysis phase to uncover complex relationships that may not be apparent with linear regression.\n",
    "4.Domain Knowledge:\n",
    "  If there is a theoretical or domain-specific reason to believe that the relationship is best represented by a polynomial, it may be appropriate to use polynomial regression.\n",
    "5.Caution with Overfitting:\n",
    "  When using polynomial regression, it's crucial to be cautious about overfitting. Regularization techniques or model selection methods (e.g., cross-validation) can help mitigate this risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, polynomial regression is a valuable tool when dealing with non-linear relationships in the data. \n",
    "However, it should be applied judiciously, considering the risk of overfitting and the interpretability of the resulting model. \n",
